You and your friends could suggest things to bet on, comment and rank the suggestions.

For view the code live you'll need to run a local server. One way for doing it, is  to run simple HTTP Server with Python using "$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer" and visiting your local host: http://localhost:8000/.
